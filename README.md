# This Project is now dead.
It served my purpose for a capstone. Should I want to return to it, it will need rebuilding from the ground up with newer experiences and better everything.

# CPSC 498 Capstone - UExchange

UExchange is designed to make it easy for college students to find help with common and uncommon tasks alike, like moving furniture, finding rides, finding old textbooks, and more. Using a simple and responsive UI build with React Native, UExchange will be available on both iOS and Android from the same source code. This makes it easy for college students to connect with each other for a common goal of helping each other thrive. 

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system. 

If you would like to use a local backend, you can find my repo for that [here](https://github.com/mattpassarelli/Capstone-Service-Exchange-App-backend)

### Prerequisites

What you need to install the software and how to install them

```
- NodeJS
- The expo CLI (see below)
- The expo mobile app on your iOS or Android device/an equivalent simulator on your computer
```

### Installing

```
1) Clone the repo with "git clone https://github.com/mattpassarelli/Capstone-Service-Exchange-App.git"
2) Install the Expo CLI if it is not already with "npm install -g expo-cli"
3) cd into Capstone-Service-Exchange
4) Run "npm install" to grab all the node modules
5) Run with "npm start"
6) Connect with your smartphone/tablet or click on "Open in iOS Simulator/Android Emulator" in the Expo tab that opened in your internet browser
```

## Deployment

I'm constantly working on this. If the app is unable to connect, check api-config.js to make the appropriate backend URL is being used (whether or not you're using a local backend or not).
